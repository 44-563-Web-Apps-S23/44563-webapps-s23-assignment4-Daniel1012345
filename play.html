        <p><h6>KATE.</h6> I only guessed.</p>

        <p><h6>LADY SIMS.</h6> Is that the usual thing?</p>

        <p><h6>KATE.</h6> Oh, yes.</p>

        <p><h6>LADY SIMS.</h6> They don't try to get it?</p>

        <p><h6>KATE.</h6> I don't know. That is what we are told to say in the letters.</p>

        <p>[_To her at present the only important thing about the letters is
        that they are ten shillings the hundred._]</p>

        <p><h6>LADY SIMS.</h6> <p>[_Returning to surer ground._]</p> I should explain that my
        husband is not a man who cares for honors. So long as he does his
        duty----</p>

        <p><h6>KATE.</h6> Yes, I have been putting that in.</p>
