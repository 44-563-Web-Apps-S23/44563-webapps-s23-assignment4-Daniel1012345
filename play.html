        <p>KATE. I only guessed.

        LADY SIMS. Is that the usual thing?

        KATE. Oh, yes.

        LADY SIMS. They don't try to get it?

        KATE. I don't know. That is what we are told to say in the letters.

        [_To her at present the only important thing about the letters is
        that they are ten shillings the hundred._

        LADY SIMS. [_Returning to surer ground._] I should explain that my
        husband is not a man who cares for honors. So long as he does his
        duty----

        KATE. Yes, I have been putting that in.

        LADY SIMS. Have you? But he particularly wants it to be known that he
        would have declined a title were it not----

        KATE. I have got it here.

        LADY SIMS. What have you got?

        KATE. [_Reading._] "Indeed, I would have asked to be allowed to decline
        had it not been that I want to please my wife."

        LADY SIMS. [_Heavily._] But how could you know it was that?

        KATE. Is it?
